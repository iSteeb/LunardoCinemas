        <p>The client wants to target not only their loyal customer from before, but also local cinema goers who would normally drive to modern cinemas in nearby larger towns.
This area should tell customers these things:<br>
* The cinema has reopened after extensive improvements and renovations.<br>
* There are new seats: standard seats and reclinable first class seats<br>
* The projection and sound systems are upgraded with 3D Dolby Vision projection and Dolby Atmos sound.<br>
* See https://professional.<wbr>dolby.com/cinema/ (Links to an external site.) and https://professional.<wbr>dolby.com/cinema/dolby-atmos (Links to an external site.) and http://www.dolby.com/us<wbr>/en/platforms/dolby-cinema.html for more information. (Links to an external site.)</p>

      <section id="seats">
        <h2>seats</h2>
        <p>The client wants to show pictures of their new seats: standard seating and first class seating. Images for the seats are provided in the original repository.<br>
The Cinema offers discounted pricing weekday afternoons (ie 12pm weekday matin√©e sessions) and all day on Mondays.<br>
Seat Prices<br>

The content above should be integrated and adapt nicely in all screen sizes but no explicit instructions have been provided. This is an analysis and implementation task for you to think about and you may discuss ideas with other students.</p>

      <section id="showing">
        <h2>showing</h2>
        <p>This area should have 4 panels that shows details for each movie. These panels will have a "front" and a "back" side which will show different information (details below) and a "flip" effect should be triggered with a :focus pseudo state (and an optional :hover state if you wish).<br>
* On the front: a movie poster, along with the name of the movie and the rating (eg PG, MA, R etc.). Tip: It will help if the poster images are all the same height and width as each other.<br>
* On the back: a short synopsis of the movie plot should be show along with a list of day / times that the movie is playing, and a "book now" hyperlink which should be styled to look like a button. This link should take the user to a booking.php page along with a GET header containing the movie id, eg the action movie link should direct the user to "booking.php?movie=ACT". Tip: This url can be hard coded, but in the next assignment you are expected to create module code to generate these panels.<br>
The content in the movie panels should adapt to large, medium and small screens, the layout for the front of each panel is described below:<br>
* Small / Mobile View: The panels should be displayed "1 up", ie in a single column, internal contents should also be displayed in a single column with the movie poster below the title and rating.<br>
* Medium / Tablet View: The panels should be displayed "1 up" as per the Small / Mobile View but the internal contents should be displayed in two columns, the poster on the left and the title and rating on the right.<br>
* Large / Desktop View: The panels should be displayed "2 up", ie two on one row, with the internal contents displayed in two columns as per the Medium / Tablet View.<br>
The content in the back of each panel should adapt nicely in all screen sizes but no explicit instructions have been provided. This is an analysis and implementation task for you to think about and you may discuss ideas with other students.<br>
The table below shows which movies have been selected by the client and when they are playing:<br>
